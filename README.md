# Intro

Demo project to practice DI and AOP with Java.

It is intended for practicing refactoring a clump of codes into a testable one, so the connectivity is not actually working.

If you want this project to actually interact with other systems, you may need to prepare a lot of stuff like creating and running a MySQL database, registering Slack app, starting an OTP service, and more.

# Pre-requisite

- JDK 11+
- Maven 3.6+
